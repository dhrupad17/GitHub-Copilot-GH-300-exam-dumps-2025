=========



The suggestions that Copilot offers appear as grayed-out text ahead of your cursor.



To accept a suggestion, select the Tab key or the > (right arrow) key.

To reject a suggestion, keep typing or select the Esc key.



The command palette provides quick access to the various functions in Copilot, so you can perform complex tasks with only a few keystrokes.



Copilot chat is an interactive feature that enables you to communicate with Copilot by using natural language. You can ask questions or request code snippets, and Copilot provides responses based on your input.



Inline chat enables context-specific conversations with Copilot directly within your code editor. You can use this feature to request code modifications or explanations without switching contexts.



Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+I (Windows or Linux) or Cmd+I (Mac) to open inline chat.



Slash commands are shortcuts that allow you to quickly perform actions in Copilot.



Here are some common slash commands and their usage:



/explain - Provides an explanation of the selected code.

/suggest - Offers code suggestions based on the current context.

/tests - Generates unit tests for the selected function or class.

/comment - Converts comments into code snippets.



Automated Test Generation

-------------------------



Select a function or class.

Use the command palette to select Copilot: Generate Unit Tests.

Review the test cases that Copilot suggests for your code.

**Introduction to prompt engineering with GitHub Copilot** 

**========================================================**



**Principles of prompt engineering - Single / Specific / Short/ Surround**



**How Copilot learns from your prompts** 



**Zero-shot learning - GitHub Copilot generates code without any specific examples, relying solely on its foundational training.** 



**One-shot learning- a single example is given, aiding the model in generating a more context-aware response.** 



**Few-shot learning-Copilot is presented with several examples, which strike a balance between zero-shot unpredictability and the precision of fine-tuning.** 



**GitHub Copilot user prompt process flow**



**1. Secure prompt transmission and context gathering**

**2. Proxy filter**

**3. Toxicity filtering (Hate speech and inappropriate content: )**

**4. Code generation with LLM**

**5. Post-processing and response validation**

6\. Suggestion delivery and feedback loop initiation

7\. Repeat for subsequent prompts



GitHub Copilot in the code editor does not retain any prompts like code or other context used for the purposes of providing suggestions to train the foundational models. It discards the prompts once a suggestion is returned.





LoRA fine-tuning(Low-Rank Adaptation) 

Here's how LoRA works:



LoRA adds smaller trainable parts to each layer of the pretrained model, instead of changing everything.

The original model remains the same, which saves time and resources.

**Using advanced GitHub Copilot features**

**===========================================================================**



**When GitHub Copilot is enabled, it provides you with suggestions. These suggestions are called ghost text.**



**Visual Studio Code has a feature called agents that allows you to interact with GitHub Copilot. These agents allow you to ask questions using a specific context. For example the @terminal agent helps you chat with GitHub Copilot to interact with the terminal.**



**Another agent is @workspace, which is aware of your entire workspace. It allows you to ask questions about the entire project. To use an agent, prefix your question with the agent, for example: @workspace how can I package this project?.**



**/doc: Adds comments to the specified or selected code.**

**/explain: Gets explanations about the code.**

**/generate: Generates code to answer the specified question.**

**/help: Gets help on how to use Copilot chat.**

**/optimize: Analyzes and improves the runtime of the selected code.**

**/tests: Creates unit tests for the selected code.**



@terminal: Provides suggestions based on the terminal output.

Example: @terminal How do I fix the error message I'm seeing?

@file: Focuses on the content of a specific file.

Example: @file Can you help me refactor this function in main.py?

@directory: Considers the contents of a specific directory.

Example: @directory How can I optimize the scripts in the utils directory?

GitHub Copilot Across Environments: IDE, Chat, GitHub.com, and Command Line Techniques

==============================================================================



How to improve GitHub Copilot Chat responses



File references: You can specify a particular file in your question by adding a #file: before the file name.



Environment References: You can reference the entire solution or workspace by using @workspace. This allows Copilot Chat to consider the broader context of the projects and configurations that are currently open in your Visual Studio IDE. 



**Slash commands in GitHub Copilot Chat allow you to quickly specify the intent of your query.**



**/explain: Provides explanations for selected code. This is particularly useful when you need to understand what a particular piece of code does.** 





/fix: Proposes fixes for problems in the selected code. If you're facing issues, you can highlight the problematic section and use /fix to receive suggestions for resolving the issue.



/generate: Helps in generating new code based on your requirements. For example, /generate code to find the root of a number in client.js will create a function to perform the task.



/optimize: Analyzes and suggests improvements to the running time or efficiency of the selected code. For instance, /optimize the calculate method in controller.js will focus on enhancing the performance of that specific method.



/tests: Automatically creates unit tests for the selected code. You can simply highlight the code and use /tests using Mocha to generate tests.





Common commands

---------------

If you're unsure about what a specific command does, you can ask Copilot to explain it. For instance: gh copilot explain "sudo apt-get"



Need help with constructing a command? You can ask Copilot to suggest a command based on what you want to accomplish:  gh copilot suggest "Undo the last commit"



Executing suggested commands: After receiving a suggestion, you can choose the Execute command option.  ghcs suggest "What command to see running docker containers"



Alias Configuration: If you want Copilot to execute commands on your behalf directly, you need to set up the ghcs alias. Using an alias allows you to bypass copying and pasting commands manually, and instead Copilot does it for you.
